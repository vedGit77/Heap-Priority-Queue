A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a **complete binary tree**. Generally, Heaps can be of two types:

Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. 
The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. 
The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

Applications: Heap sort, Priority queue


NOTE: Complete Binary tree
A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all the levels are completely filled except possibly the lowest one, 
which is filled from the left. A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences.
1. All filled except possibly yhe last lvl
2. All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
